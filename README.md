This is an academic project for a personal website.
I have learnt and used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to create client-side and admin-side webpages.

Note: You must have Xampp installed on your computer.

To open the project, follow the steps given below.

1. Clone the repository to the Xampp>htdocs folder on your computer.
2. Start the Apache service in the Xampp Control Panel
3. Go to the localhost of Xampp in your browser.
4. In the browser, open the folder Ruparelia_40164863 in the Xampp directory.
5. Open the file index.php.
6. To check the admin-side of the webpage and update the client-side details, go to the admin tab.
7. Enter the given credentials: (Username: Bhavya, Password: 123456).
8. Thereafter, you can check other features on the webpage.

Thanks for checking out my project :)
